    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    Effective date: 01/07/2025
    <br>
    Welcome to Manwhameter, our private book rating website (“the Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
    <br>
    This platform is privately run by an individual, for a small group of invited users. It is not a commercial service or a business.
    <br><br>
    <h2>1. Access and Membership</h2>
    Access to this website is by invitation only.
    <br>
    You must have an account to use the Service.
    <br>
    You are responsible for keeping your login credentials safe.
    <br><br>
    <h2>2. Purpose of the Service</h2>
    This website is intended for users to:
    <ul>
        <li>Rate and comment on books, mangas and webtoons.</li>
        <li>Share personal opinions in a respectful and private setting.</li>
        <li>This is not a fully public platform, however content should still remain appropriate and respectful.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    By using the Service, you agree to:
    <ul>
        <li>Use it only for personal, non-commercial purposes.</li>
        <li>Refrain from posting illegal, offensive, or harmful content.</li>
        <li>Respect the privacy of other users.</li>
        <li>Not attempt to exploit or attack the system in any way.</li>
        <li>You remain solely responsible for the content you post.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>4. Content and Moderation</h2>
    All content is provided by users. The site owner does not verify or guarantee its accuracy.
    <br><br>
    The owner reserves the right to remove any content or user account at any time, for any reason, especially if it violates these terms.
    <br><br>

    <h2>5. Visibility of Ratings and Comments</h2>
    By posting comments and ratings (linked), or any other content on the Service, you understand and agree that this content will be visible to all other registered users of the website.
    <br>
    While the website is private and access is restricted to invited users only, your comments are not private and can be read by anyone who has access to the Service.
    <br>
    Furthermore, your ratings will be used in the calculation of the average grade of the books you rated, average grades that are public to anyone, even those who don't have access to the service.
    <br><br>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Liability</h2>
    The Service is provided “as is”, with no warranties of availability, performance, or accuracy.
    <br>
    The site owner is not liable for any damages resulting from the use or misuse of the Service.
    <br>
    This is a private, informal project; no professional or commercial responsibility is assumed.
    <br><br>

    <h2>7. Data and Privacy</h2>
    Minimal personal data is collected (e.g. username, password, IP address).
    <br>
    Data is used only for login, security, and internal usage.
    <br>
    Your data will not be shared or sold.
    <br>
    For more details, please read the <a routerLink="/privacy-policy" class="text-secondary fw-bold">Privacy Policy</a>.
    <br><br>

    <h2>8. Copyrighted images</h2>
    As stated before, users are fully responsible for the content they publish on the platform.
    <br>
    However, I think it's necessary to remember that images you find online aren't always free to use, so try to find free images to illustrate the books you add to the platform.
    <br><br>

    <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    These Terms may be updated in the future. You will be notified on the billboard if any significant changes are made.
    <br><br>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the site administrator at <strong>{{'manwhameter@gmail.com'}}</strong>.
